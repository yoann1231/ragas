What is ragas 0.3,"- experimentation as the central pillar - provides abstraction for datasets, experiments and metrics - supports evals for RAG, LLM workflows and Agents","{'answer': 'Ragas 0.3 is not explicitly defined or mentioned in the provided documents. However, based on the information given:\n\n- Ragas are melodic frameworks in Indian classical music (Document 1).\n- They are used to evoke specific emotions in the listener (Document 2).\n- They can be performed on various instruments or sung vocally (Document 3).\n\nFrom this, we can infer that ""Ragas 0.3"" might refer to a version or iteration of a system, software, or project related to ragas—possibly involving their classification, generation, or emotional mapping—given the numerical suffix ""0.3,"" which often denotes a developmental version in technology contexts. However, without additional context, this remains speculative.', 'run_id': '20250717_130818_1014', 'logs': 'logs\\rag_run_20250717_130818_1014_2025-07-17T13-08-21-046982.json'}",fail,logs\rag_run_20250717_130818_1014_2025-07-17T13-08-21-046982.json
how are experiment results stored in ragas 0.3?,"- configured using different backends like local, gdrive, etc - stored under experiments/ folder in the backend storage","{'answer': 'The provided documents do not contain any information about ""RAGAS 0.3"" or how experiment results are stored in it.
